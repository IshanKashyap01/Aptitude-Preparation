# Calendars

- A normal year of 365 days has 52 complete weeks and 1 odd day

- Therefore, for a normal year, the first and last days would be the same

- If 1st January of a year is a Monday, 30th December will be a Sunday

- Moreover, the 1st January of next year will be Tuesday

- Similarly, if the first year was a leap year, the 1st January of the next year
will be a Wednesday

- For any date of a year, the same in the next year will be at least one day
of the week ahead

## Example

If the 11th August of 2019 was a Sunday, what was the day at the same date in
1983?

- There are 36 years in b/w the 2019 and 1983, therefore, there are 36 extra
days

- The leap years in b/w are '84, '88, '92, '96, '00, '04, '08, '12 and '16

- Therefore, 9 extra days for leap years, which means a total of 45 extra days

- $\because 45 \% 7 = 3$, Therefore, there is a difference of three days of the
week

- As we are going back in time, the day would be Thursday
