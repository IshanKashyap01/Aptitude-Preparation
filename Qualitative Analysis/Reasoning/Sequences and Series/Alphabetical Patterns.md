# Alphabetical Patterns

Sequences & series are essentially about *pattern recognition* based on numbers
or alphabets

**Q. 1** If DELHI is coded as CCIDD, then what will be the code for JAIPUR?

- For each letter, the code is $P_{alphabet} - P_{word}$ where P is the position.

**Q. 2** Next in the sequence: JAF, JEF, JIF, JOF, ?

- Pole letters remain same while the middle letters are vowels in sequence.

- Therefore, answer is JUF

**Q. 3** Next in the sequence: BAZ, DBY, FCX, ?

- Middle letters are in alphabetical order, first letters in +2 while last letters
are -1.

- Therefore, answer is HDW
