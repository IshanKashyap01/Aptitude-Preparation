# Time And Work

## Two or more people, same work, different effciencies

A & B, 12 & 15 days. A + B = ?

Let work be LCM(12, 15) = 60
A w/d = 5, B w/d = 4
A + B = 9 w/d
60 work = 60 / 9 days

## People work, some leave, some join or Pipes & Cisterns

**Q. 1** A & B work for 2 days, B leaves, after 1 day, C joins. A, B and C can alone
do the same work in 10, 12 and 15 days

- Let work be LCM(10, 12, 15) = 60
- A = 6/d, B = 5/d, C = 4/d
- For 2 days: 2 \* (A + B) = 22
- Next day: w += 6 => w = 28, left over = 32
- C joins: 10/d \* days = 32 => days = 3.2 more days.

**Q. 2** A fills a tank completely in 12 hrs, B in 15 hours. C hole empties in 10 hrs

- Let tank's size be LCM(12, 15, 10) = 60 L
- A = 5/h, B = 4/h, C = -6/h
- (A+B+C) \* t = 60
- 3 \* t = 60
- t = 20 hours to fill the tank

## Man Days

20 men, 8 days $\equiv$ 10 men, 16 days $\equiv$ 1 men, 160 days

work = 160 man-days

**Q. 1** Certain number of men can finish a work in 55 days. If 6 more men joined,
it could be done in 44 days. No. of men?

- m \* 55 = (m + 6) \* 44
- 5 \* m = 4 \*(m + 6)
- m = 24 men
- Alternately, using product constancy, days decrease by 20% (1/5)
- Therefore, men should increase by 25%(1/4)

**Q. 2** 10 men, 6hr/d, 18 days. 15 men, ? hr/d, 12 days, 2x work

$$
{m_1 \times d_1 \times t_1 \over m_2 \times d_2 \times t_2} = {w_1 \over w_2}
$$

$$
\therefore{10 * 6 * 18} = 2 \times {15 * t * 12} \\
t = 12 hrs / day
$$

## Men, Women and Children

**Q. 1** 20 women does a work in 16 days. The same work can be done in 15 days by 16
men. What is the ratio of their efficiency?

$$
20w \times 16d = 16m \times 15d \\
{md \over wd} = {20 * 16 \over 16 * 15} \\
man-days : woman-days = 4 : 3
$$
