# Introduction to Alligation

- It is a **visual method** to solve weighted average questions involving the **mixing**
**of two groups**

- The formula for weighted average can be re-arranged as follows:

$$
{n_1 \over n_2} = {A_2 - A_w \over A_w - A_1}
$$

- This is known as the **Alligation formula**

- Now, we have to visualise this on the number line and we can see that
$x \times(n_1 + n_2) = A_2 - A_1$

- That is $x \times (n_1 + n_2)$ is the distance b/w $A_1$ and $A_2$

- Moreover, the distance of both numbers from the average will be: $A_1 + (x \times n2)$
and $A2 - (x \times n1)$

- Using this, we can deduce the average weight by the formula:

$$
A_w = A_1 + (x \times n2) = A2 - (x \times n1)
$$
where
$$
x = {A_2 - A_1 \over n_1 + n_2}
$$

## Situations for Alligation
