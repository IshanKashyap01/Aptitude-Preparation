# Problems for Alligation

1. There are two mixtures of milk & water, one with 40% milk and 60% water and
the other with 50% of each. If both the mixtures are mixed in a ratio of 2:3,
what will be the average percentage of milk in the mixture?

    - Either forget water and solve the question for milk

    - Of find percent of water and subtract it from 100 to get milk

2. Let there be two mixtures of gold & copper in ratios 3:8 and 2:13. After
mixing them in the ratio 3:5, what is the ratio of gold to copper?

    - Here, using alligation is not a good idea but we can still use it

    - Gold will be 2/15 and 3/11 in the mixtures, use this on the number line

    - We can use the ratio method and find the LCM of 15 and 11 (165)

    - Now, multiply it to 3:5 and we'll get the value of both mixtures in the new
    mixture (495 + 825 = 1320)

    - Now, we can multiply these values with their respective fractions (either Au
    or Cu) and get the answer

3. A shopkeeper sold a table and chair costing 2k and 4k for 30% and 60% profit
respectively. Find the average profit percentage.

    - Ratio of cost: 1:2 and profits: 30 and 60

    - Use the ratio as weights and profits as values

4. A shopkeeper sold a table and chair at a profit and loss of 20% and 30% thereby
he made no profit or loss. What is the ratio of cost prices?

    - Weights will be -30 and 20, while average will be 0

    - The ratio will be 2:3
