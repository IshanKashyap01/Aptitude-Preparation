# Introduction

- It is a number that helps make sense of a given list of no.

$$avg = \sum(numbers)\over COUNT(numbers)$$

- In other words, if you replace each number in the list, the *average will remain*
*the same*

- It is one of the **three measures of Central Tendency (C-tendency)**, which are
```Mean```, ```Median``` and ```Mode```

- Median is the *middle number of the sorted list* while mode is the *most occuring*
*number*

- Median is good for *evenly distributed data* while mode is good *when the same*
*value appears a lot of times*

- However, average is the *most important of the three*
