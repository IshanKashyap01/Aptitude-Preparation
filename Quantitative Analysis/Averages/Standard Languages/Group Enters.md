1. A batsman has an average of 55 in 120 innings and he wants to increase it to
100 by 300 innings. What should be his average for the next 180 innings?

    - Maintain 100 and contribute enough to increase average by 45

    - $ 100 + {120 \times 45 \over 180}$

2. After 83 innings, a batsman's average is 48. He scores 100 in the 84th innings.
What's his new average?

    - 100 will maintain his 48 for 84 innings while adding an extra 52 runs
    which should be equally divided into the group to find the new average

    - Therefore, $48 + 52 \times 84$ is the new average
