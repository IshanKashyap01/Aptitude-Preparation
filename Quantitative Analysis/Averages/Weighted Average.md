# Concept of Weighted Average

- In this concept, each number will have a weight ```w``` along with its value ```n```

- This can also be represented as a group of numbers with the average of ```n```
with total number of elements as ```w```

- Suppose, we have two groups with $n_i$ elements and $avg_i$ average

- The average of the group formed by merging the two will be:

$$Avg = {n_1 \times avg_1 + n_2 \times avg_2 \over n_1 + n_2}$$

- Hence, the average weight of ```m``` groups will be:

    $$Avg = {\sum_{i = 1}^{m}n_i \times avg_i} \over \sum_{i = 1}^{m} n_i$$

    where n is the number of elements
