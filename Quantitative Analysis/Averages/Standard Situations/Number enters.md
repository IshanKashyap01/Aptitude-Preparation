# A Number Enters a Group of Numbers

- The structure was common in all the questions in standard language - I

- Like 24S, 1P $25 \times 15 - 25 \times 14 = 39$

- This situation can be describes as: **when 1 number enters the group**

## Example

- 5 numbers' average is 12 and 6th number enters. Average of all becomes 15. What
is the 6th number?

- Here, we can do $15 \times 6 = 12 \times 5 = 30$ to get the answer

- An alternate would be to imagine 5 stickers of 12. A new enters and all becomes 15.

- The deviation will be of +3 hence, the new number must **maintain 15 and contribute**
**the change in average of the first 5 numbers**

- Therefore, **maintain + contribute = new number**

- Here, the number needs to contribute +3 for 5 numbers, i.e. $5 \times 3 = 15$

- Hence, the number will become $ 15 + 5 \times 3 = 30$

## Questions from Standard Language - I

1. Maintain 15, contribute 1, 24 times $15 + 1 \times 24 = 39$

2. 100 will maintain $x + 8$ and contribute +8 for 9 innings therefore,
$100 = x + 9 \times 8$

3. Maintain 5000 and contribute 800 for the other 11 months, therefore,
$5000 + 800 \times 11$

4. Maintain 47.5 and contribute -2.5 for the other 19, therefore,
$47.5 - 2.5 \times 19 = 0$

Hence, in all the questions, from this pov becomes the same question asked three
times
