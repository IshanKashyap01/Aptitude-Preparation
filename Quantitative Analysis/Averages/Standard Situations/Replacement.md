# Replacement of a Number

- In this situation, say, we have 5 numbers with average of 13. One number is
replaced and the average increases by 4

- If the average increases, the new number must be larger otherwise smaller

- The number then must contribute $4 \times 5 = 20$ while maintaining the old
average of 13, which also means:

    $$N_{new} - N_{old} = \text {contribution of the new number}$$  

    or

    $$N_{new} - N_{old} = n \times \delta (average)$$

- Which means, the difference b/w the new and old number is 20

- Now, if you know one of the numbers, you can find the other as well

- You have one equation and you just need another to solve.

- Hence, question can give you sum, ratio or product of the two numbers
