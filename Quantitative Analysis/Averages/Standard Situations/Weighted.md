# Standard Situations in Weighted Average

1. Prices and weights (purchase situation)

2. Speed and time (average speed)

3. Investments and returns (average returns)

4. Alloys and mixtures

5. Class and sections or boys and girls (average marks)

6. Average salaries

- Basically, situations where we've been given ratio of things and their numbers

- Hence, first of all, you should carefully determine the weightages and the numbers

- Secondly, you must **always simplify the ratios** to find the average
