# A Group of Number Enters Another Group of Numbers

- Suppose a two numbers are added to a group of 8 numbers with an average of 10
making the new average to be 13

- The new numbers must maintain 13 and contribute 3, 8 times, i.e. $13 + 3 \times 8 = 37$

- Here, 37 is the average of the new group of numbers

- Now suppose, 180 new numbers are added to 120 numbers with average of 50 and
the new average is 100

- $100 + {180 \times 50 \over 120}$ will give the average value of the added numbers
