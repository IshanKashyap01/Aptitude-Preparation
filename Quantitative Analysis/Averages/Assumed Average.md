# Assumed Average Approach

- ```Deviation``` from a number for each number in the list is calculated as
$avg - number$

- The sum of deviation for the ```average``` is **always zero**

- Hence, we can *assume* the average and check the deviation for accuracy

- The actual average can then be calculated as:

$$
AVG = \text {assumed average} + AVG(\text{deviations from assumed average})
$$

- While **average deviation** is the $\sum deviations \over COUNT(numbers)$

## Tips

- Try to assume a number closest to all the numbers and try to do the calculations
in your head

- Try to get as much speed as possible by getting good at addition and subtraction
