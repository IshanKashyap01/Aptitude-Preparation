# Trains

- The questions will usually have a train cross an object

- This object can have a length or it can be a point

- A train is said to have started crossing an object when it's head reaches the
head of the said object

- Similarly, it is said to have crossed the object when it's tail reaches the
tail of the said object

- The concepts and formulae for relative motion will remain the same
