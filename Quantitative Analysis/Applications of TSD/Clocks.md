# Clocks

- The hands of a clock make both straight lines and right angles twice per hour

- The minute hand moves $360\degree / hr$ and the hour hand moves $30\degree /
hr$

- Therefore, their relative speed will be $330\degree / hr$

- Straight lines occur at $0\degree$ and $\pm 180\degree$ whereas right angles
occur at $\pm 90\degree$ and $\pm 270\degree$

- Hence, you will calculate the distance to the given angle(s), then solve with
the relative speed
