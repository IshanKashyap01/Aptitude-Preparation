# Boats & Streams

- The boat will have its own speed and there will be a speed for the current

- The boat's speed will increase if it is moving in the same direction as the
current

- Similarly, its speed will decrease if it's moving in the opposite direction

- Therefore, you will have an extra variable for the speed of the current

- If the speed of a boat in both directions are given, to find the boat's speed:

    1. You can substitute the speeds in the equations from $S = S_B \pm S_C$

    2. Or you can take the average of the two speeds which is the speed
