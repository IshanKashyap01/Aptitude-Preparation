# Probability Questions Based on Dice

## A Dice is Rolled Once

- For an unbiased dice, the probability of each number will be $1 \over 6$

- Any question can be solved using either the sample space or the `and`/`or`
approach

## Two Die are Rolled or One Die is Rolled Twice

- The following table shows the number of ways the given sum of the die can be
achieved:

| sum | ways | sum |
|-----|------|-----|
| 2   | 1    | 12  |
| 3   | 2    | 11  |
| 4   | 3    | 10  |
| 5   | 4    | 9   |
| 6   | 5    | 8   |
| 7   | 6    |     |

- For ex. the probability of the sum of the two die to be a prime number can be
calculated as:

  - $P(E_{prime}) = P(2) + P(3) + P(5) + P(7) + P(11)$

  - Where each $P(n)$ value comes from the `ways` column for the respective `n`
