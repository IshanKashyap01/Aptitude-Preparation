# Probability Questions Based on Balls From Boxes

Suppose there is a bag with 10 red, 5 blue and 1 black balls.

## w/ Replacement

- We draw 3 balls. The probability of all 3 to be red will be: $P(R)^3$

- The probability of all 3 to be the same colour would be: $P(R)^3 + P(Bu)^3 + P(Bl)^3$

## w/o Replacement

- The probability of all 3 to be red will be: $P(3R) = {10 \over 16}\times{9 \over 15}$
$\times{8 \over 14}$

- The probability of all 3 to be the same colour would be:
${(10 \times 9 \times 8) + (5 \times 4 \times 3) + (1 \times 0 \times 0) \over 16 \times 15 \times 14}$
