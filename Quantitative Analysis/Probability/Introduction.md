# Introduction to Probability

- The probability of an event is defined as the ratio of favourable outcomes to all possible outcomes

  - $P(E) =$ { $|E| \over{|U|}$ | $ E \in U$ } Where, $U$ is the universal set

- The universal set can be represented as a sample space **iff**:

    1. The sample space is **exhaustive** i.e. contains all possible outcomes

    2. The probability for all the outcomes is the **same**

- There are following types of questions on probability:

    1. Coins

    2. Dice

    3. Cards

    4. Balls from boxes

    5. Word-based

## Useful Tips & Tricks

- Probability questions are mostly language-based, i.e. what you need to do is
hidden in the wording of the question

- The question can ask the probability for:

    1. Event A **and** B (and so on) occur in the same experiment

    2. Either one **or** the other event occur in the experiment

    3. A combination of the above two

- Consider the probability for (independent events) either `A` and `B` happening
or `C` in an experiment

- The probability will be calculated as: $P((A \& B) | C) = P(A) \times P(B) + P(C)$

- Just like P&C, `and` translates to **multiplication** and `or` translates to
**addition**

- Some questions such as *balls, cards and word-based* comes with two options:

    1. **W/ Repetition**: Objects picked at one event are placed back before the
    next event

        - It's the same as repeating the same experiment again and again

    2. **W/O Repetition**: Objects picked at each event are removed for the next
    event

        - $U$ changes after each event, therefore, each successive experiment will
        have different $|U|$ and probably a different $|E|$ as well
