# Word-Based Questions on Probability

**Q.1** What's the probability for a year to have 53 sundays?

- In a year, there are 52 weeks i.e. 52 sundays and 1 extra day

- The probability of that day to be a sunday is & 1 \over 7$

- Similarly, for a leap year, there are 2 extra days

- Therefore, the probability of either to be a sunday would be $2 \over 7$

**Q.2** What's the probability for the product of five numbers to not be divisible
by 2 or 5?

- The last digits of either numebers cannot be 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 0 and can be 1,
3, 7, 9

- Therefore, the probability will be: $(4 \over 10)^5$

**Q.2** In a 3 match one-day series of India vs England, the probability of India
to win a match is 0.6. What is the probability for India to win the series?

- For India to win the series, they can either win all three matches or two of
them

- $P(I_{series}) = P(3I) + P(2I \& 1E)$

- $P(I_{series}) = (0.6)^3 + (0.6^2 + 0.4) \times {3! \over 2!}$

- The $3! \over 2!$ are the ways India can win 2 matches in the series
