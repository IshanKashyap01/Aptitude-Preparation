# Problems on Ratios

1. 252 is divided among A, B and C such that 1/3rd of what A gets is the same as
1/5th of what B gets, which is 1/4th of what C gets. How much does each get?

    - Ratio will be 3 : 5 : 4

2. 500 is divided among A, B, C and D such that A and B gets 3x what C and D get,
B gets 4x that of C and C gets 1.5x that of D. How much does each/one of them get?

3. Milk and water mixtures of 3 : 8 and 2 : 7 are mixed in equal quantities. What
is the ratio of milk to water in this new mixture?

    - Take LCM of 3 + 8 and 2 + 7, which is 99.

    - Take 99L of each mixture, find quantites of milk and water in each then add
    them up and simplify to find the final ratio

4. Incomes of P and Q are in the ratio 1 : 2 while their expenditures are in the
ratio 1 : 3. If both of them save Rx 500, then what's the income of P?

    - Assume income as $x$ and expenditure as $y$ then solve for the equations
    thus obtained

5. Rs. 232 is divided b/w 150 boys and girl such that Rs. 1 is given to each girl
and Rs. 2 are given to each boy. How many boys and girls are there?

    - If all 150 were girls, total would be 150 and Rs. 82 will be left

    - As each boy will get +1 more than a girl, by adding 82 boys, we'll distribute
    Rs. 164 to boys and Rs. 68 will remain

    - These Rs. 68 can be divided into 68 girls so we 232 divided into 150 boys
    and girls exactly as specified

6. A begger has 1, 2 and 5 rupees coins in the ratio 5 : 15 : 12. If the overall
amount he has is Rs 95, then how many coins of each denomination he owns?

    - Multiply values and ratio and solve like a normal ratio question
