# Variations

## Direct Variation

- $x$ directly varies with $y$ i.e. $x \propto{y}$

- If $x$ increases by 20% (1/5) then $y$ also increases by 20% (1/5)

## Inverse Variation

- $x$ inversely varies with $y$ i.e. $x \propto{1 \over {y}}$

- If $x$ increases by 25% (1/4) then $y$ decreases by 20% (1/5)

## Joint Variation

- $x$ varies jointly with $y$ and $z$ i.e. $x \propto{yz}$
