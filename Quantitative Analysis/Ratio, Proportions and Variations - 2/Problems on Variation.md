# Problems on Variation

1. x varies with y such that when x is 18, y is 7. Find x when y is 21.

    Ex. Duration of a railway journey varies directly with distance and inversely
    with velocity. Velocity varies directly with the square root of coal used, and
    inversely with the number of carriages. In a journy of 50 km for 30 mins, 18 carriages
    are carried and coal used is 100 kg. How much coal will be used in a journey of
    42 km in 28 mins with 16 carriages?

2. A precious stone worth 12,250 is accidentally dropped and broken into 2 pieces in
a 2 : 5 weight ratio. If the price varies directly with the square of the weight,
then how much loss is incurred?

3. A train without bogies run at 42 kph. If the speed reduction is inversely proportional
to the number of carriages and with 9 bogies, the speed is 24, then what is the
maximum amount of bogies with which the train will just run?

    - Find number of bogies for 0 kph then subtract 1 from it
