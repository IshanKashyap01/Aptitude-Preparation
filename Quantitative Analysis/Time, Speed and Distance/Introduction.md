# Introduction to Time, Speed & Distance

- The units for time, speed and distance in questions can be:

    1. Distance: `km`, `m`, `ft`, `miles`

    2. Time: `min`, `sec`, `hour`

    3. Speed: `kph`, `m/s`, `k/min`, `mph`, `ft/s`

- In an equation with these three, their units must be consistent

- The conversion for `kph` into `m/s` is given by: $1 kph = {5 \over 18} mph$

- It can be remembered by the fact that the value always decreases when converting
to `m/s` from `kph`

## proportionality of Time, Speed and Distance

1. $s \propto{d}$ if time is constant

2. $t \propto{d}$ if speed is constant

3. $s \propto{1\over{t}}$ if distance is constant

- From `3`, we can deduce $s_1 : t_1 = s_2 : t_2$

- In the questions where one term is constant, the other two's variations can be
found using the above relations

- Concepts from `Percentages` can also be used in suitable questions
