# Circular Motion

- Speed can also be given in *percentage* per unit time and time in time taken
to complete a round

- There can be one of the following conditions:

    1. First meeting at starting point: `LCM` of times taken by everyone to complete
    a round

    2. First meeting: `LCM` of times taken by the fastest w.r.t. each and everyone

## Example

The speed of A, B and C in a circular circuit of 6 kms is 5 m/s, 10 m/s and 20 m/s.
They start from the same point, A and B move in the same direction whereas C moves
in the opposite

1. After how much time will they meet again?

    - $s_{CA} = 25 m/s$ and $s_{CB} = 30 m/s$

    - Therefore, $t_{CA} = 240 s$ and $t_{CB} = 200 s$

    - LCM of both will be 1200 seconds

2. After how much time will they meet again at the starting point?

    - time taken by A, B and C will be 1200 s, 600 s and 300 s

    - Their LCM will be 1200 seconds
