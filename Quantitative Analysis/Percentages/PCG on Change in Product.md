# PCG Applied to Change in Product

Suppose, $x$ is increased by $20\%$ and $y$ is increased by $30\%$. Find the
percent change in their product

- Here, assume $x \times y$ is $100$

- Now, all changes to $x$ and $y$ applies to $100$ as well

- Moreover, the order of these percent changes doesn't matter

$$
100 \xrightarrow{20\%} 120 \xrightarrow{30\%} 156
$$

- Therefore, the percentages should be chosen in a way that makes calculations
as easy as possible

## Problems on Product Change

1. The length and breadth of a rectange are increased by 30 and 10 percent respectively.
What is the percent change in its area?

2. The price of a product goes up by 20% and its consumption decreases by 10%. What is
the change in expenditure?

    $$
    \text {unit sales} \times \text {selling price = revenue}
    $$
    Therefore,
    $$
    price \times consumption = expenditure
    $$

3. The speed of a car in increased by 30% and the time travelled was decreased
by 40%. What is the percent change in distance?
