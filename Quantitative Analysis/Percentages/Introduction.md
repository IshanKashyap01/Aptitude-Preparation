# Introduction to Percentages

$${p \over q} \times 100 = \%value$$

- Suppose $x$ is becoming $y$. The percent change b/w *x and y* or *x to y*:

    $$
    {y - x \over x} \times 100
    $$

- Calculate percent value by breaking the percent into sums of $10\%$ and $1\%$.

- For ex. calculate 23% as $10\% \times 2 + 1\% \times 3$

### Structure 1

$$
40 \overset{?} {\underset {+12} {\xrightarrow{}}} 52
$$

Here, you have to find the % change by:

$${change \over original} \times 100$$

### Structure 2

$$
40 \underset{?} {\xrightarrow{30\%}} ?
$$

- Here, you have to find the resulting value and absolute change

- $30\%$ of $40$ is the absolute change, while adding the said change will give
the final value
