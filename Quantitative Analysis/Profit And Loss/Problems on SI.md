# Problems on Simple Interest

- Principal, rate and amount are given. Find time and SI.

$$
T = {I \over {SI}}
$$

- P @ SI after 4 yrs is 1240 while after 10 yrs is 1600. Find sum, SI, and rate.

  - Find SI by the equations $P + 4I = 1240$ and $P + 2SI = 1600$

  - Equate the SI found in one of the equation to find principal

- A lent B 6k for 2 yrs and 1.5k to C for 4 years and made 900. What was the rate
of interest?

$$
{6000 * r * 2 \over{100}} + {1500 * r * 4 \over{100}} = 900
$$

- A sum of money becomes 2x in 10 years. Find the rate of interest per annum.

$$
\because {10 yr \rightarrow{100\%}} \\
\therefore {1 yr \rightarrow{10\%}}
$$
