# Introduction to Profit & Loss

- The amount it costs to the seller to acquire a product is called its **cost price**

- The base price for sale, deduced from cost price, is called the **mark up price**

- The actual price of sale to a customer, is called the **selling price**

- If $\text{cost price > selling price}$, then the seller made a **profit** else
a **loss**

- Both can be calculated by **percentage/absolute change** from cost price to selling
price

- If the change is negative, it means there's a loss else a profit
