# Simple and Compound Interest

## Simple Interest

- It is the return on investment over the capital invested

- Therefore, **SI** is the same for each year

$$
P \xrightarrow{rate} SI
$$

- For ex. if an investment of 100 gives at 10% p.a. S.I. for 3 years, each year
you will gain the same amount i.e. 10

$$
SI = {P \times {R} \times {T} \over {100}}
$$

## Compound Interest

- It is the return on investment along with the interest earned

$$
100 \xrightarrow{10\%} 110 \xrightarrow{10\%} 121
$$

- Amount for CI is calculated by the formula:

$$
A = P(1 + {r \over{100}})^t
$$

## Problems on Compound and Simple Interest

- For an investment of 2 yrs, CI is 615 while SI is 600. Find the principal.

  - CI and SI for the first year is the same

- Difference b/w SI and CI fr 2 yrs @ 20% p.a. is 48. Find principal.
