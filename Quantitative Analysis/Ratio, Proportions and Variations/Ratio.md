# Introduction to Ratio

- Ratio is a method fo comparing quantities of same unit

- It is always unit-less as they get cancelled out

$$
a : b = ma : mb
$$
Where a and b are co-prime

$$
\because {a \over b} = {c \over d} = {e \over f} = k \\
\therefore {a + b + e \over b + d + f} = k
$$

Also,

$$
\because {c : d} < {a : b} \\
\therefore {a + c \over b + d} < a : b
$$

Similarly

$$
\because {c : d} > {a : b} \\
\therefore {a + c \over b + d} > a : b
$$

- To simplify 1/2 : 3/5 : 7/6, multiply each fraction with the LCM of their denominators

## Chain Ratio

- If a : b, b : c, c : d etc. are given as $n_1/d_1$, $n_2/d_2$, $n_3/d_3$ etc. then,

$$
a : b : c : d = n_1 n_2 n_3 : d_1 n_2 n_3 : d_1 d_2 n_3 : d_1 d_2 d_3
$$
