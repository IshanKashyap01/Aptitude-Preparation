# Introduction to Permutations & Combinations

- Permutations and combinations is all about counting

- For tougher situations we will need to use formulae

- The situation to formula mapping is the key

- There are ~14 formulae in this chapter:

    1. Selection -> 6

    2. Distribution -> 2

    3. Arrangments -> 4

        - Regular: 2

        - Circular: 2

- The questions will be word-based where an `and` condition will translate to
**multiplication**

- Whereas, an `or` condition will translate to **addition**
