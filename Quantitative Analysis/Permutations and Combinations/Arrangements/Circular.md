# Circular Arrangements

- If all positions are equal, and there are `n` people to be arranged in `n`
circular positions:

  - We can do so in $(r - 1)!$

- If a position is marked, say out of 5 in a circular arrangement:

  - The marked position can be arranged in only one way

  - Moreover, it gives us a reference point to arrange the rest

  - Therefore, the arrangement for the rest will be $4!$
