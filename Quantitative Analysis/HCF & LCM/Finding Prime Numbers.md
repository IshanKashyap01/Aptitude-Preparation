# Quantitative Shortcuts & Finding Prime Numbers

- A prime number is always **odd** and its last digit **cannot be 5**

- Therefore, while checking for prime, skip multiples of 2 and 5

- Until 90, only need to check for 3

- From 91 to 120, check only for 3 and 7

- From 121 to 200, check for 3, 7, and 11
