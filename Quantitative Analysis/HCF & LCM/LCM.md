# Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)

- It is the product of all prime factors of the given numbers w/ their highest
powers

- All common multiples are multiples of LCM

- If the numbers are co-prime, then their LCM will be their product

- For any **two numbers (only)**, ```x*y = LCM*HCF```

## LCM & HCF of Fractions

- First of all, the fractions must be in their simplest form

- LCM will be the **LCM of numerators** divided by the **HCF of denominators**

- HCF will be the **HCF of numerators** divided by the **LCM of denominators**
