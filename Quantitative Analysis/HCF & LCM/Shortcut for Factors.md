# Shortcut for Finding Factors

- It is the number that can divide the given number w/o leaving a remainder

- Factor and divisors are the same thing

- 1 and the number itself are the factors of every number

- Two numbers whose product is the given number, are called **factor pair** of
that number

- In a *factor pair*, ```factor1 <= sqrt(num) <= factor2```

- **An even number cannot divide an odd number**, hence, an odd number will never
have even factors

- Factors are relevant in all except the **Higher Math** category of problems

## Steps for Finding Factors

- Find factors in pairs by dividing the pairs in LHS & RHS

- Get prime factors from previous RHS and composite from previous LHS

- If you encounter a prime in RHS, no more factor pairs will be possible

- If a number doesn't have any factor pairs until its sqrt, its a **prime number**
