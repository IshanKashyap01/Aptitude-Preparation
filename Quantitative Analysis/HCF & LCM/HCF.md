# Concept & Shortcuts for Highest Common Factor (HCF)

## Concept of HCF

- It is also known as **Greatest Common Divisor** (GCD)

- Find all the prime factors w/ their powers for each number

- HCF is all the common primes with their least powers

- While LCM is all the primes with their highest powers

## Shortcut for Finding HCF

### For Two Numbers

- Find the difference b/w the two numbers and its factors

- The largest factor of the diff. that divides the smaller number is the HCF

### For More Than Two Numbers

- Sort the numbers in ascending orders

- List the difference of all adjacent numbers

- The HCF of the numbers will be the HCF of these differences

- This method is recursive and can be used until only two differences remain
